Reflection on assignment
</h2>
It was pretty easy to use the Knight Lab tool to create the interactive timeline, but I ran into some problems updating it when I edited the spreadsheet. It was pretty easy to use as long as I had the information and data I needed to upload it to the tool. The tool fit into the story this time because it visualized the timeline of Dean's career, from her first single to her first Grammy. It would help engage audiences because it's easy to use and can sum up her career without writing much. I also liked the ability to include multimedia elements, such as her music videos, albums, and Instagram posts. One problem I could not solve was that Instagram posts had to be opened on Instagram to see the content. That is why I opted to use mostly YouTube and Spotify embeds/links. I think because we have been working on these assignments on VSC, that format was easier for me to understand immediately. However, WordPress makes it pretty easy to publish content, and there's less you have to do (e.g., pushing to GitHub and updating the page every time). I've used WordPress before and never really used the code page, so it was interesting to try out.
