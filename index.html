    Northwestern University's cooking club <a href = "https://www.cookologynu.com/"> Cookology</a>  hosted their annual pop-up restaurant Thursday evening at Sheil Catholic Center.

    A reservation for the club’s biggest event is highly coveted and often hard to get. Students who were able to attend experienced a three-course meal inspired by street food. The menu included items like:
    </p>
    <!-- list -->
    <ul>
        <li> Tacos </li>
        <li> Chicken Satay </li>
        <li> Hotteok </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Each course was served in roughly 20-minute windows and the Cookology chefs rushed to keep up with the timeline.
